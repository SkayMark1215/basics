# basics
Basic concepts I have studied

Here you can find my examples of C++ programming concepts (short programs implemented to achieve small tasks) and my programming style.
Most of these examples are made within the scope of Bjarne Stroustrup's book "Programming: Principles and Practice using C++ (2nd edition)", some of them are lab work from my —Åollege and the other are tasks from Udemy course.

If you have any ideas or proposals, welcome!

Best wishes!
